    "bio": "I do a little bit of everything. I am a quick learner, and I love a challenge. The reason I pursued a career in tech is that it is constantly changing. I embrace and seek out the next disruptive technology. I feel the reason I can adapt quickly to new concepts or technologies is that I have a solid core skillset consisting of many programming languages, Cloud, Configuration Management, and Infrastructure as code. Combine those skills with a DevOps mindset, and I am confident I will meet any business need.",
